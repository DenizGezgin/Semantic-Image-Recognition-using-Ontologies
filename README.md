# Semantic-Image-Recognition-using-Ontologies

Machine learning is a widely employed statistical learning approach known
for its remarkable performance across various fields. Nevertheless, it is not
without its limitations, primarily stemming from its statistical nature. Some
of these drawbacks include sub-optimal performance when confronted with
limited data and scalability issues. To address these limitations and make
machine learning solutions more versatile for a broader spectrum of projects
and disciplines, we leverage the semantic capabilities of ontologies.
An ontology is essentially a specification of entities and their interconnections. In the realm of computer science, ontologies serve as schemas for
metadata, offering an organized, machine-readable representation of terms
and their relationships. Additionally, they provide a framework for describing a knowledge base populated with individual entities (Kulmanov et al.,
2021). By harnessing the power of ontologies, we have developed a fully
semantic model tailored to the task of labeling frog images. Our model
achieved an overall accuracy of 81%.
Our study concludes that our specialized model outperforms other general models trained on limited data and general-purpose image recognition
models, such as DenseNet, in the specific task it was designed for. Our model
comprises two integral components: computer vision and ontology, working
synergistically to logically infer frog classes based on input images. However, itâ€™s important to note that while a purely semantic approach proves
invaluable for small-scale applications, it does come with certain drawbacks,
such as a limited label pool and reduced accuracy as the scale of the project
increases.
The primary objective of this research is to construct a semantic image
recognition model and, in the process, gain a deeper understanding of the
1
distinctions between semantic models and traditional mathematical models.
Leveraging semantic models to tackle machine learning challenges represents
a relatively innovative approach, and ongoing research continues to explore
the benefits and limitations of this approach. Our aim is to thoroughly
document and analyze the development of this model, shedding light on
what can be gleaned from our efforts for future research endeavors in this
burgeoning field.
